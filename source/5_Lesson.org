- Below you'll find drawings of each of the parts of the Cam mechanism that you are manufacturing.
- None of the parts are to scale, so read the dimensions carefully

- After creating all the parts in SolidWorks. Upload *one* screenshot of *the follower guide*.
- Adapt two of the Cams you have made, so that they have crosses in the centre to fit the axle.

- Create an Assembly of your mechanism. The other 5 pieces needed are in the open drive > Design Engineering > Year 7 > 4 - Mechanisms.
- These need to be saved into your area before you can begin assembling the frame.
- The image below should help you understand how the pieces fit together.
