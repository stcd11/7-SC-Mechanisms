- A Pulley is a wheel on a shaft that can move a belt along it's circumference.
- Pulleys can be used to lift loads and transmit motion.

- We can use pulleys to increase or decrease the speed of rotary motion.
- Look at the diagram below
[[https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/97fe6399a4d793223ee9826adee2b5017e17d385.gif]]
- The =driver= pulley has a diameter of 40mm and revolves at 100 revolutions per minute (=rpm=).
- The =driven= pulley has a diameter of 120mm
- If we want to calculate the rpm of the driven pulley, we first need to find out the =velocity ratio=.
#+begin_html
<math>
<mi>velocity ratio</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mi>diameter of driven pulley</mi>
<mi>diameter of driver pulley</mi>
</mfrac>
</math>
#+end_html
- So in this case we can see that...
#+begin_html
<math>
<mi>velocity ratio</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mn>120</mn>
<mn>40</mn>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>3</mn>
</math>

- The output speed of a pulley system is calculated as follows.
#+begin_html
<math>
<mi>output speed</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mi>input speed</mi>
<mi>velocity ratio</mi>
</mfrac>
</math>
#+end_html
- So in this case we can see that
#+begin_html
<math>
<mi>output speed</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mi>100</mi>
<mi>3</mi>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>33.3</mn>
</math>
#+end_html
- So the driven pulley will rotate at 33.3rpm.

- For each of the problems below - draw a diagram of the pulleys described and then calculate the answer.
  1. A driver pulley has a diameter of 200mm and rotates with a speed of 60rpm. Calculate the speed of a driven pulley with a diameter of 50mm.
  2. A driver pulley has a diameter of 80mm and rotates with a speed of 250rpm. Calculate the speed of a driven pulley with a diameter of 400mm.
  3. A driver pulley has a diameter of 100mm and rotates with a speed of 50rpm. Calculate the required diameter of a driven pulley if we want it to rotate at 125rpm.
  4. We have a driver pulley with a diameter of 60mm. And a driven pulley with a diameter of 20mm. What speed will the driver pulley need if the driven pulley must rotate at a speed of 90rpm?
  5. A driven pulley has a diameter of 10mm and must rotate at a speed of 100rpm. What diameter will the driver pulley need if it can only rotate at 25rpm?

- The mechanism you are going to build can either be cranked by hand, or run from a motor using a pulley system.
- In this next activity you are going to build the pulleys for your mechanism.
- Here are the parts for your pulley mechanism.

- Use SolidWorks to draw sketches of the pulley parts above and then extrude them by 3mm.
- Take screenshots of your work and ensure you are including the part that proves your sketch is fully defined.

- You can create pulley mechanisms in SolidWorks that actually work.
- Follow the guide below and see if you can create a simple pulley mechanism.
- Firstly you'll need to create a couple of pulley wheels and place them into an assembly as shown below. These pulleys have extra holes, just so that you can see them spinning.
[[file:img/pulley1.PNG]]
- Now we'll need to make sure they are lined up with each other, by mating two of the faces.

- Next we add a belt. Belts can be found in the =Assembly Features= menu.
[[file:img/pulley3.png]]
- Select the curved faces of both your pulleys.
[[file:img/pulley4.PNG]]
- Lastly we'll need to float the first pulley you placed in the Assembly. At the moment it is fixed and so can't move. Right click on the pulley and select =float= from the context menu
[[file:img/pulley6.png]]
- If you want you can now add a motor to the driver pulley, like you did in the cams lesson.

- Create a pulley mechanism using more than two pulleys.
- Animate the pulleys using a motor for the driver pulley.
