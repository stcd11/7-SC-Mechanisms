- The initial build for this project won't take long.
- You're going to build the basic frame of your mechanisms project, before designing the cams.
** Build It Part 1
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Collect the pieces you will need.
[[file:img/build/build_1.jpg]]
- First you'll need the base and the two corner supports.
[[file:img/build/build_2.jpg]]
- Apply some PVA glue to the finger-joints of the supports.
[[file:img/build/build_3.jpg]]
- Then insert them into the base.
[[file:img/build/build_4.jpg]]
- Now take the side struts and apply a little more glue to the finger-joints and along the edges.
[[file:img/build/build_5.jpg]]
- Fix them using the corner supports, so that they are perpendicular to the base.
[[file:img/build/build_8.jpg]]
- Next you'll need the follower guides.
[[file:img/build/build_9.jpg]]
- Apply glue to the finger joints, and insert them between the verticle struts.
[[file:img/build/build_10.jpg]]
[[file:img/build/build_11.jpg]]
- And that's the first part of the build completed.
** Badge It - Silver
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- Take a picture of your completed frame and upload it to www.bournetolearn.com.
** Build It Part 2
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Collect the pieces you will need.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_1.jpg]]
- First you'll need the pulley crank handle part - with the hole in it.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_2.jpg]]
- Use the countersink tool to countersink the hole and then place the machine screw through it and tighten the nut on the opposite side using the spanner.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_3.jpg]]
- Next collect the following 2 parts and place them together as seen below.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_4.jpg]]
[[file:img/build/build_part2_5.jpg]]
- Now use some PVA glue and glue the one end.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_6.jpg]]
- Now slide the other pulley side (no hole) over the cam shaft.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_7.jpg]]
- Next slide the pulley into place and put PVA glue on the flat surface.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_8.jpg]]
- Next, place the hexagonal part in place and then glue the flat surface.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_9.jpg]]
- Finally, place the first pulley handle in place and slide them to the end.
[[file:img/build/build_part2_10.jpg]]
[[file:img/build/build_part2_11.jpg]]
- Now tape these parts to the side of your frame, *Do not push it through the frame, as this will glue it in place.*
