- The initial build for this project won't take long.
- You're going to build the basic frame of your mechanisms project, before designing the cams.

- Collect the pieces you will need.
[[file:img/build/build_1.jpg]]
- First you'll need the base and the two corner supports.
[[file:img/build/build_2.jpg]]
- Apply some PVA glue to the finger-joints of the supports.
[[file:img/build/build_3.jpg]]
- Then insert them into the base.
[[file:img/build/build_4.jpg]]
- Now take the side struts and apply a little more glue to the finger-joints and along the edges.
[[file:img/build/build_5.jpg]]
- Fix them using the corner supports, so that they are perpendicular to the base.
[[file:img/build/build_8.jpg]]
- Next you'll need the follower guides.
[[file:img/build/build_9.jpg]]
- Apply glue to the finger joints, and insert them between the verticle struts.
[[file:img/build/build_10.jpg]]
[[file:img/build/build_11.jpg]]
- And that's the first part of the build completed.

- Take four photos of your first build phase
- You'll need a plan elevation, front elevation, side elevation and a perspective elevation.
- The diagram below should help you.
