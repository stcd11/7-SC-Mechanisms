** 2. Pulley Calculations
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: document
:END:

For each of the problems below - draw a diagram of the pulleys described and then calculate the answer.

- a)  A driver pulley has a diameter of 150mm and rotates with a speed of 30rpm. Calculate the speed of a driven pulley with a diameter of 50mm.
- b)  A driver pulley has a diameter of 70mm and rotates with a speed of 200rpm. Calculate the speed of a driven pulley with a diameter of 350mm.
- c)  A driver pulley has a diameter of 100mm and rotates with a speed of 60rpm. Calculate the required diameter of a driven pulley if we want it to rotate at 150rpm.
- d)  We have a driver pulley with a diameter of 80mm. And a driven pulley with a diameter of 40mm. What speed will the driver pulley need if the driven pulley must rotate at a speed of 90rpm?
- e)  A driven pulley has a diameter of 10mm and must rotate at a speed of 200rpm. What diameter will the driver pulley need if it can only rotate at 50rpm?

** 3. DC Motors
:PROPERTIES:

** 5. C.A.D. usage
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:

Answer the following questions:
-  a) What is the meaning of the term C.A.D?
-  b) How does making a 3D model of a product help a design team develop the product?
-  c) Do you thing there is no need to use an expensive piece of equipment such as a laser cutter to make a model? Explain your answer.
** 6. Mechanism Design
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:

A local florist has asked you to design a model to be placed next to the checkout. The mechanism (shown Below) is nearly complete but a simple mechanism needs adding. The mechanism must make the characters arm move up and down in a fairly smooth movement. 
-  a) Complete the drawing by adding the mechanism.
-  b) Explain how it works?
